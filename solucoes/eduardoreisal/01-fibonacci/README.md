# Challenge: Fibonacci

## Description
The challenge was proposed by, ![venezianluis]('https://github.com/venezianluis'), one
of my mentors on the "trilha de dados" an initiative of Grupo Boticario to teach code.
The goal of this challenge is to create a program capable of getting the first n numbers
of the Fibonacci sequence.
